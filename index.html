                <h3>Master thesis</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>After starting the last step of my master program in february
                    2025, I am doing the research for my master thesis for a
                    total of 9 months. My deadline is now approaching, as I'm
                    writing this; deadline: january 2026.

                    For the reearch I moved to Stockholm, Sweden, where I am now
                    doing my thesis at the Oskar Klein Centre.
                    My thesis is in the field of cosmology; more specifically,
                    I am trying to improve the parameter constraints from 
                    cosmological parameter estimation by including Cosmic
                    Microwave Background (CMB) observations.

                    In doing do, we hope to improve paramter constraints and are
                    especially interested in the resulting contraint on the sum
                    of neutrino masses.

                <h3>This website</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>By leraning the basics of HTML and CSS mainly, I hope to be
                    able to build basic websites and create a digital space
                    where I can present some random stuff and broaden my 
                    skillset while doing so.    
                    Nowadays with the push of AI and 'everyone being able to 
                    make a site' I think it still is a valuable skill to be able
                    to interact with the back-end and create a website.
                    [also, AI is sheit, so let us exercise our brain instead of
                    a digital brain that burns trees while online in some data
                    center that invades the local ecosystem]

                <h3>Micro-songs</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>This is a long living idea of mine, where I record original
                    pieces of music. 
                    Starting with guitar and possibly adding a bass and drum-
                    track if I ca acces this easily through basic software.

                    The idea is to become better at 'writing' music by making 
                    short compositions, made up from 3 to 5 guitar tracks and 
                    a basic rythm section.
                    By making small pieces in different genres this will not
                    only push my creativity on the guitar but also help me to
                    just flop out some chords, see what keys and melodies work
                    with it and expose myself to different styles of guitar
                    playing.
                    In doing so, I can also see whether the the process of
                    recording is fun and if I want to push myself to create more
                    extensive pieces.
